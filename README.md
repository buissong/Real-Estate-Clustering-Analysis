# Real-Estate-Clustering-Analysis
In an in-depth exploration of the Dallas real estate market, I spearheaded a cluster analysis project using data sourced from Redfin. My objective was to decode the complexities of the market by segmenting properties into distinct categories that share common characteristics.

The project began with meticulous data preparation, focusing exclusively on properties within the Dallas area, and particularly on Single Family Residential, Townhouse, and Condo/Co-op types. I scrutinized the dataset, which consisted of 1,286 listings, for outliers and missing values, ensuring a clean and reliable basis for analysis.

Employing k-means clustering, I identified five distinct property clusters based on key variables: price, beds, baths, square feet, and price per square foot. This analysis revealed a spectrum of housing from high-end luxury to more economical offerings, each with its unique footprint in the market.

Further, hierarchical clustering complemented this analysis by uncovering natural groupings within the dataset, presenting a hierarchical view of the market segments from standard to premium properties.

Visualization techniques, including a constellation plot and a geographic distribution map, were employed to provide visual narratives of the clusters' relationships and their spatial distribution across Dallas. This comprehensive approach not only highlighted the market diversity but also informed potential marketing and investment strategies by illustrating how property features correspond with geographical locations.

Through the application of both k-means and hierarchical clustering, I uncovered nuanced insights into the Dallas housing market, providing a robust framework that Redfin can leverage for data-driven decision-making. The project underscored the strengths and limitations of each clustering method, showcasing their collective value in delivering a multifaceted overview of the real estate landscape.
